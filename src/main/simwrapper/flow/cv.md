This scene shows one intersection with a mixed share of <span style="color:red">CVs</span> (red) and <span style="color:green">AVs</span> (green).
Automated vehicles are parametrized as such, that they drive more "defensively", meaning larger headway, less impatience and less deviation to the speed limit.
The results below show that due to this driving style the available flow capacity is even reduced when assuming a mixture of both vehicle types.
